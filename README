ABOUT
=====
bookmark-djvu and bookmark-djvu-extract are wrappers around DjVuLibre's
djvused(1) program. They allow for the simple modification and extraction
of DjVu outlines (aka. bookmarks).

The input format for bookmarking is close to what DjVuLibre's djvutxt(1)
provides.

INSTALL
=======
you only need djvused:
Debian, Ubuntu: $ apt-get install djvulibre-bin
Fedora: $ yum install djvulibre perl-Test-Simple

USAGE
=====
run './bookmark-djvu --help' and './bookmark-djvu-extract --help' for usage
and commandline option information.


INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT
===================
example input file:
%< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %<

Cover 1
Preface . . . 3
d=4
Chapter 1 1

    Subsect 1.1 ......2
    Subsect 1.2 3
        SubSubsect 1.2.1	4

%< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< 

each outline item is of the form
<INDENTATION> <TITLE> <SEPARATOR> <PAGE-NUMBER>.

Page numbering starts with 1.

Child outline items are indented with four spaces.

A line of the form 'd=NUMBER' will add NUMBER to all following PAGE-NUMBERS
until the next 'd=NUMBER' marker or the end of file. NUMBER can be negative.

The separator between <TITLE> and <PAGE-NUMBER>  consists of dots and/or
whitespace.

Blank lines are ignored.

Note that with this format it's impossible to have trailing dots
or whitespace in a title. Also it's impossible to have newlines in titles.
Maybe we will provide YAML as an input/output format in the future.

TESTS
=====
the tests are run with
$ cd t/ && ./test
