ABOUT
=====
bookmark-djvu and bookmark-djvu-extract are wrappers around DjVuLibre's
djvused program. They allow simple modification and extraction
of DjVu outlines.

INSTALL
=======
you need djvused, perl >=5.14 and YAML::XS:

dpkg-based (Debian, Ubuntu):
$ apt-get install djvulibre-bin libyaml-libyaml-perl

rpm-based (Fedora):
$ yum install djvulibre perl-YAML-LibYAML perl-Test-Simple

USAGE
=====
run
  $ ./bookmark-djvu --help
and
  $ ./bookmark-djvu-extract --help
for usage and command-line option information.

INPUT/OUTPUT FORMATS
====================
Two output formats are supported: YAML (see wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) and our
own 'simple format'.

Both have in common:
- encoding must be UTF-8.
- page numbering starts with 1. bookmark-djvu will complain if a page number
is out of range.

YAML
====
%< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %<
- title: Cover
  page: 1
- title: Preface
  page: 3
- title: Chapter 1
  page: 5
  kids:
    - title: Subsect 1.1
      page: 6
    - title: Subsect 1.2
      page: 7
      kids:
        - title: SubSubsect 1.2.1
          page: 8
- title: Index
  page: 9
%< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %<

SIMPLE FORMAT
=============
The same outline as above in simple format:
%< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %<
Cover 1
Preface . . . 3
d=4
Chapter 1 1

    Subsect 1.1 ......2
    Subsect 1.2 3
        SubSubsect 1.2.1	4
Index: 5
%< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< 

each outline item is of the form
<INDENTATION> <TITLE> <SEPARATOR> <PAGE-NUMBER>.

Child outline items are indented with four spaces.

A line of the form 'd=NUMBER' will add NUMBER to all following PAGE-NUMBERs
until the next 'd=NUMBER' marker or end of file. NUMBER can be negative.

The separator between <TITLE> and <PAGE-NUMBER>  consists of dots and/or
whitespace.

lines containing only whitespace are ignored.

Note that with this format it's impossible to have trailing dots
or whitespace in a title. Also it's impossible to have newlines in titles.
Use YAML format if you need this. 

TESTS
=====
the tests are run with
$ cd t/ && ./test

KNOWN BUGS
==========
bookmark-djvu-extract produces YAML with alphabetically ordered mappings, in
contrast to the more sane ordering used in the above example.
